# 2048
![](2048/meta/apple-touch-startup-image-640x920.png)
In 2048, you slide numbered tiles on a 4×4 grid. Tiles with the same number merge into one when they collide, doubling their value. After each move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears. The goal is to create a tile with the number 2048, though you can keep playing beyond that.

## Updates
I updated the style in [main.css](main.css) and added some extra useful pages:
- [Gamerules](play.html)
- [Detailed Gamerules](play_2.html)
- [About Us](about.html)
